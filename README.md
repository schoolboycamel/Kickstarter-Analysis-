# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Perform data analysis on crowdfunding projects in order to uncover hidden trends. This will enable Louise to understand hidden trends that would enable her crowdfunding project to be successful.  Understanding and organizing the data by the use of filtering and formatting was first implemented in order to uncover only the data that was useful for Louise. We implemented conditional formatting in order to give our data a visual feedback, such as in the _outcomes_ column, which enabled us to have a visual link to specific situations. Visuals were added in order to interpret the values of all of the categories, and theater plays were essentially filtered as it was the crowfunding projects she was interested in. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Analysis based on launch data was implemented in order to understand trends that would enable louise to understnad which months of the year have higher demand on theater and plays. This would increase the chances of having a successful project. 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Analysis on outcomes based on goals was implented in order to understand the percentages of successful, failed, and canceled projects based on a certain funding goal. With the iplmentation of the graph, we came to the conclusion that Louise should focus on the plays that had a funding goal that ranged from $0 to $5000 and should stay away from higher amounts. 
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The implementation of the **COUNTIFS** function was taken into considartion as having medium levels of difficulties. Debugging these functions could have been a difficult task
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
Best months to launch a project are in May and June
Worst month to launch a project is in december. 
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
we came to the conclusion that Louise should focus on the plays that had a funding goal that ranged from $0 to $5000 and should stay away from higher amounts. 
- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
- Outcomes based on countries 
- Filtering through othe projects and understanding trends that may benefit more than theaters and plays.
